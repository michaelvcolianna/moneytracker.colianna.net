# MoneyTracker

This is a small and simple piece of budget-tracking software I made to keep track of personal finances. Since it only made it for me, there are probably some tests that don't pass. Validation is minimal since I won't use it wrong. It's mainly a portfolio piece to show that I can plan & execute a proof-of-concept like this pretty quickly.

This will not be merged, hopefully. Or maybe now that I've fixed actions.
